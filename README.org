* Introduction

Graphite is a simple starter configuration for Emacs. It implements a basic and much simpler version of the modules system in [[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs][Doom Emacs]]. In graphite, the package installation is decoupled from package configuration. Packages are only installed or updated when the user explicitly asks emacs to do it rather than have it installed or updated on startup.

* Install

Clone this repository.

#+begin_src sh
  git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/codemicmaves/graphite-emacs ~/graphite
#+end_src

Add the following line to =~/.emacs.d/init.el=

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
